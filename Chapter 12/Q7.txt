Write a program to generate personalized junk mail. The program takes input both from an input file and from the keyboard. The input file contains the text of a letter, except that the name of the recipient is indicated by the three characters #N# . The program asks the user for a name and then writes the letter to a second file but with the three letters #N# replaced by the name. The three-letter string #N# will occur exactly once in the letter.
